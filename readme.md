In Alfred, you can create custom searches here :

However they are very limiting to my needs. I have over 300 + web searches and I love to use prefixes to quickly scope the web search I want to make. 

I want to make a dedicated workflow that is incredibly easy to extend and edit that would essentially put all web searches on a single hotkey and would allow me to fuzzy search and make any web search I want to make in a second.
