## Description 📕
This workflow similar to [DuckDuckGo Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang?) allows you to fuzzy search through a selection of websites that you can add and contribute to in [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches/blob/master/workflow/websites.csv).

You simply search for the website you want to scope your search too, press enter and make your search.


Each search has a prefix to signify the theme or scope of the search. For example results prefixed with `r: ` will search through subreddits. Here is the full list of prefixes and their descriptions.

|  prefix |  description |
|---|---|
|  r: | search subreddits on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)  |
|  d: | search documentation websites |
|  g: | search GitHub |
|  s: | search stack exchange sites |
| f:  | search forums |
| t:  | search Google Translate |
| w:  | search ordinary websites (none of the above) |

Each prefix also has a corresponding icon for visual feedback of prefix meaning. 

And since the workflow allows for fuzzy searching, you can even make searches like that :

And they will match.

You can also attach a hotkey that will take the selected text and then will let you search for that text on any of the websites.

## Install 💎
Download the workflow from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches/releases/latest).

## Contribute 💜
If you use and like this workflow, you can add your own websites that you think are missing to the CSV file [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches/blob/master/workflow/websites.csv). 

It has a simple structure of argument, followed by comma and then what website is going to be searched. Where the query you are searching for is replaced with `tester`.
