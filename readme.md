> [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow to search through any website on the web (easily extendable list)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zbD3tSl.png" width="500" alt="img">

This workflow similar to [DuckDuckGo Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang?) allows you to fuzzy search through a selection of websites that you can add and contribute to in [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches/blob/master/workflow/websites.csv).

You simply search for the website you want to scope your search too, press enter and make your search.

Each search has a prefix to signify the theme or scope of the search. For example results prefixed with `r: ` will search through subreddits. Here is the full list of prefixes and their descriptions.

|  Prefix |  Decription |
|---|---|
|  r: | Search subreddits on Reddit  |
|  d: | Search documentation websites |
|  g: | Search GitHub |
|  s: | Search stack exchange sites |
| f:  | Search forums |
| t:  | Search Google Translate |
| w:  | Search ordinary websites (none of the above) |

Each prefix also has a corresponding icon for visual feedback of prefix meaning. 

And since the workflow allows for fuzzy searching, you can even make searches like that:

And they will match.

You can also attach a hotkey that will take the selected text and then will let you search for that text on any of the websites.

## Installing
Download the workflow from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches/releases/latest).

## Developing
If you want to add features and things to the workflow. I advise you to install [this Alfred CLI tool](https://godoc.org/github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred) by running:

`go get -u github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred`

You can then make the changes to the code and run `alfred build` inside this repo to build the workflow to `workflow` directory. You can then use the built binary from Alfred script filters.

## Contributing
[Suggestions](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches/issues) and pull requests are highly encouraged!

If you use and like this workflow, you can add your own websites that you think are missing to the CSV file [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches/blob/master/workflow/websites.csv). 

It has a simple structure of argument, followed by comma and then what website is going to be searched. Where the query you are searching for is replaced with `tester`.
