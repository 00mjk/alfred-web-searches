> [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow to search through any website (easily extendable list)

This workflow similar to [DuckDuckGo Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang?) allows you to fuzzy search through a selection of websites that you can [add and contribute to](CONTRIBUTING.md#readme).

You simply search for the website you want to scope your search too, press enter and make your search.

Each search has a prefix to signify the theme or scope of the search. For example results prefixed with `r:` will search through subreddits. Here is the full list of prefixes and their descriptions.

| Prefix | Description                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| r:     | Search subreddits on Reddit                  |
| d:     | Search documentation websites                |
| g:     | Search GitHub                                |
| s:     | Search stack exchange sites                  |
| f:     | Search forums                                |
| t:     | Search Google Translate                      |
| w:     | Search ordinary websites (none of the above) |

Each prefix also has a corresponding icon for visual feedback of prefix meaning.

And since the workflow allows for fuzzy searching, you can even make searches like that:

And they will match.

You can also attach a hotkey that will take the selected text and then will let you search for that text on any of the websites.
