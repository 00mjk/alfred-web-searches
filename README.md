> [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow to search through any website (easily extendable list)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0X9fyy4.png" width="500" alt="img">

This workflow similar to [DuckDuckGo Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang?) allows you to fuzzy search through a selection of websites that you can [add and contribute to](CONTRIBUTING.md#readme).

You simply search for the website you want to scope your search too, press enter and make your search.

Each search has a prefix to signify the theme or scope of the search. For example results prefixed with `r: ` will search through subreddits. Here is the full list of prefixes and their descriptions.

|  Prefix |  Description |
|---|---|
|  r: | Search subreddits on Reddit  |
|  d: | Search documentation websites |
|  g: | Search GitHub |
|  s: | Search stack exchange sites |
| f:  | Search forums |
| t:  | Search Google Translate |
| w:  | Search ordinary websites (none of the above) |

Each prefix also has a corresponding icon for visual feedback of prefix meaning.

And since the workflow allows for fuzzy searching, you can even make searches like that:

And they will match.

You can also attach a hotkey that will take the selected text and then will let you search for that text on any of the websites.
